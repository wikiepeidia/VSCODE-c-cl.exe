# VSCODE configured for cl.exe batch quick startup
- Quick batch file to open developer VS 2022 and configure VSCODE properly for C++/C cl.exe
- You need VS 2022 for this, if you have a lower version, consider editing the code.
- Run ` dir "\VsDevCmd*" /s ` in cmd to know the location of the DEV cmd for VS, copy the path and use it depending on what you have on your PC.

- For those who don't use VS 2022, use BTOOLS https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/?q=build+tools with the given batch file.
- TASK.json has been added because there are currently no proper ways to automatically place the outputted file into a folder, so you need to put this file in the .vscode folder.
