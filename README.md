# VSCODE configured for cl.exe batch quick startup
Quick batch file to open developer VS 2022 and configure VSCODE properly for C++/C cl.exe
You need VS 2022 for this, if you have a lower version, consider editing the code.
Run `dir "\VsDevCmd*" /s` in cmd to know the location of the DEV cmd for VS, copy the path and use it depending on what you have on your PC.
For those who don't use VS 2022, use BTOOLS https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/?q=build+tools
